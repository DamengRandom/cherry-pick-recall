# This is an example for git cherry pick knowledge recall

### 🏳  Step 1: created a codebase and make initial commit


### 🏳  Step 2: created a develop branch


### 🏳  Step 3: created a new branch branchA and made a commit


### 🏳  Step 4.1: after branchA's WIP code changes saved/committed in branch C, we come back to branchA and cherry pick the branchC's branchA's code changes
 
### 🏳  Step 4.2: create a new branch and saved the current work progress code changes and create a commit for it 

### 🏳  Step 4.3: after resolved conflicts, branch A got branchC's branchA's temporary commit code changes. Now we can merge it to continually create the PR.


### 🏳  Step 5: created a branch D and add some code changes, so later branchD 's commit will be needed to be merged into branchB
